	<p>This application parses software developer job ads and determines, for each technical skill keyword (e.g. Python, Java, C#, Javascript, etc) what other skills are most likely to go with it (e.g. for Python it would be Django, Flask, etc.) So when one is preparing for a software development interview, one could know what other areas they need to study to answer the most likely interview questions.</p>
